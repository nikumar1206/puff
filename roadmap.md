# Puff Roadmap

Puff is an evolving framework with plenty of development goals ahead.

---

### Priority Issues

- **Lack of Tests**
  No unit tests have been implemented. No profilers or load tests either.
- **Extensible Examples**
  Examples repository needs to be made more robust.
- **Code Quality**
  Significant improvements are needed in code cleanliness and readability.
- **Security Schema Support**
  Support for including security schemas, like OAuth2 and JWT on the autogenerated OpenAPI documentation.
- **TLS Support**

---

### Missing Features

- **Templating**
  No built-in templating support; need to consider whether a custom templating solution is necessary.
- **Request Validation**
  Ability to define custom validation functions for requests.

---

### Nice-to-Haves

- **Schema Generation Enhancements**
  Schema generation currently does not support enums, and Goâ€™s lack of native enums requires custom enum parsing.
- **Custom CSS for Swagger**
  Allow users to define custom CSS for the Swagger documentation page.
- **Documentation Page for Puff**
  Need a UI solution for documentation using a service like docusaurus or similar.

---

### Partially Implemented Features

- **Response Handling**
  - Currently, only user-defined JSON schemas are supported.
  - Explore options to support HTML, XML, and plain text responses.
- **Logger Accessibility**
  - The logger cannot be accessed in many parts of the app, such as middleware.
  - Add functionality for log grouping by request.

---

### Areas for Exploration

#### Performance Enhancements

- **Profiling**
  Run a profiler to identify potential optimizations before refactoring.
- **Route Matching**
  - Assess if regex-based route matching requires improvement.
  - Consider switching to a map-based route structure for efficiency.
- **Swagger Generation Overhead**
  Reduce the overhead if the user opts out of Swagger generation. Currently, some global variables and reflection may cause unnecessary load.
- **Context Pools**
  Implement context pooling to manage resources more effectively.
- **Faster JSON Serializer**
  Evaluate whether an alternative JSON serializer is faster than the standard library, or allow users to pass a custom serializer that matches the serde interface.

#### Design Review

- **Error Handling in Handlers**
  Reconsider if `puff.handler` should return an error.
